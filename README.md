<h3> Hi, I'm Lib LogBit, a logging library in Java. </h3>

  
My purpose is to make application development cleaner and more efficient when dealing with logs. I'm based on class <b>Logger</b> of package
 <i>java.util.logging</i>, bringing a higher level and compatible with the needs of current systems.
